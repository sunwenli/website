+++

Recently Packtool(an App create by electron) added autoupdate feature ，The premise is
You have to sign your app。

There was something wrong with the android group today😂。

The problem was caused by using zipalign(a tool for optimizing the apk) which integration in Packtool optimized the apk.

```
Error:

dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libc++.dylib
  Referenced from: myAppName.app/Contents/Resources/tool/mac/zipalign
  Reason: image not found
```

Obviously, these log was printed by zipalign could not found libc++.dylib.

The reason is `@rpath`, for explaining of `@rpath` maybe [this blog](http://www.tanhao.me/pieces/1361.html/) helpful.

In short,`@rpath` like a shell variable. zipalign will get the value of `@rpath` at runtime then join the `/libc++.dylib`.

In fact, at this,  `@rpath`’value should be `/usr/lib`, So why couldn't zipalign find the library. Finde answer in [this blog](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW19)

Follow these steps to solve:

> open Terminal.app

`install_name_tool -change @rpath/libc++.dylib /usr/lib/libc++.dylib myAppName.app/Contents/Resources/tool/mac/zipalign`


The simple instructions of `install_name_tool`：

> what params `install_name_tool` support？

```
install_name_tool -h
```

```
Usage: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool
 [-change old new] ... [-rpath old new] ... [-add_rpath new] ... [-delete_rpath old] ... [-id name] input
```

> modify dynamic lib’s path

```
install_name_tool -change <app'@rpath value> <real value of dynamic lib> <app’s path>
```
